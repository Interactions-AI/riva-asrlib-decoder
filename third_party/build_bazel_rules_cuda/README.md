rules_cuda
==========

This is an up-to-date set of Bazel rules to configure Linux builds with CUDA.

It is directly copied from [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/third_party/gpus) with some paths updates. Hence, you need to configure `TF_*` environment variables to make it work.

An example of `.bazelrc` you can find in the root of this repo.
